# Flutter Installation in Windows


#### Note :

If you have : <br>
 - gone somewhere and installed it before
 - installed *Dart* separately
 
 uninstall it and remove all the files. <br>

<br>

## Step 1 - Pre-requisites

> Before proceeding with *Flutter* installation, make sure you have done the following list. <br>
> I am saying this because, I have installed it in this way and this has worked for me. <br>

- [x] Installed [Git](../Git/README.md)
- [x] Installed [GitHub Desktop](../GitHub_Desktop/README.md) *(Optional)*
- [x] Proper installation and setting up of [Android Studio](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/tree/master/Android%20Studio)
- [x] Installed [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/blob/master/Microsoft%20Visual%20Studio%20Code/README.md) *(Optional but highly recommended)*

<br>

<hr>

## Step2 - Go to *Installation Folder* 

Like I have mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/blob/master/README.md) of this repository, I will be installing *Flutter* in the *LEO* folder and I suggest you to do it in the same way. <br>

Go to the *LEO* folder in the *File Explorer*.<br>
Open *Command Prompt* at that folder location by typing *cmd* and pressing *Enter* in the **Address Bar** of *LEO* folder.<br>
Type out this following command to get the **stable** version of the *Flutter SDK* in that folder. <br>

        git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
