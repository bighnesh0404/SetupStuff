# Setup Git for Windows

### Step 1 

Download Git for Windows from the official website : https://git-scm.com/downloads
<br>

<hr>

### Step 2 

If you do not have a specific folder for installations, then create a folder in C drive and name it anything you want.<br>
It is preferred if the maximum length of the folder is 8 characters.<br>
So, you will be installing it to the folder you just created and I am going to proceed with the folder that I have already created while installing XAMPP which is _LEO_.


So, in C drive, there is a folder with the name LEO.

          C:\LEO

<hr>

 ### Step 3
 
 Click on the downloaded application.<br>

### Step 4

If you had done the following steps : <br>
- Installed Git.
- Uninstalled Git.
- Installing it again.

Then, Only show new options would be _checked_ or _selected_, however you like to say it.<br>
It will look something like this :

- [x] Only show new options

Just unselect it.<br>
Click Next.<br>

If you want a Folder for Git in the Start Menu, just click Next.<br>
If you do not want it, then just select the checkbox `Dont create a Start Menu Folder`.<br>
My advice would be, just leave stuff as it is and just click Next.<br>
