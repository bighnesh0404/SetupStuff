### Step 2 

If you do not have a specific folder for installations, then create a folder in C drive and name it anything you want.<br>
It is preferred if the maximum length of the folder is 8 characters.<br>
So, you will be installing it to the folder you just created and I am going to proceed with the folder that I have already created while installing XAMPP which is _LEO_.


So, in C drive, there is a folder with the name LEO.

          C:\LEO
