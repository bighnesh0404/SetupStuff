# Setup Composer for Windows

Before installing Composer, just make sure you have added PHP to the path.<br>
If you haven't, click <a href="../Adding php and mysql to Path/" >here</a> to know more.

### Step 1 

Download Composer for Windows from the official website by clicking 
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br>

The installer will download composer for you and set up your _PATH_ environment variable so you can simply call composer from any directory. <br>

Download and run Composer-Setup.exe - it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed.<br>

### Step 2

Like I have said before in the README of this repository, I will be installing stuff to a specific folder in C drive.<br>
So, in C drive, there is a folder with the name LEO.<br>

      C:\LEO

<br>

<hr>

### Step 3
 
Click on the downloaded application.<br>

Since, I am the only person who is going to use my PC, I will be installing it for all the users.<br>

### Step 11

To check if the installation is done properly, open command prompt and type the following. <br>

<br>

You must be something similar to this. <br>
