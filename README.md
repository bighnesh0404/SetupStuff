# SetupStuff

This repository contains the instructions to install various tools that are helpful to a _developer_. <br>

By default, I will be installing these tools to one particular folder and I recommend you to do the same. <br>

You can name the folder as you wish it to be.<br>
In my view, a folder or file name with maximum 8 characters is always better.<br>
I am naming the _Installation Folder_ as _LEO_.<br>

So, in C drive, there is a folder with the name LEO.<br>

   C:\LEO

<br>

This is where all the installation will happen.
