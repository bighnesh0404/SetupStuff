# Setting up Anaconda in a Windows PC

The instructions here is for a Windows PC. <br>
For Linux and Mac, it will be added later.<br>

It would be better and preferrable if you install in a specific folder rather than the default path.<br>

Like I have mentioned before, I will installing it in the *LEO* folder.<br>


### Step 1 - Download the Application

#### Step 1.1

Open the official Anaconda website from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/).<br>

Click on _Products_.<br>

#### Step 1.2

You will be seeing something like this.<br>

Select _Individual Edition_. <br>

<br>

#### Step 1.4

Select the installer based on your system specification. <br>
I have a 64bit OS, so, I will be downloading _64-Bit Graphical Installer_. <br>

Click _Next_. <br>

<br>

#### Step 2.4

By default, the path would be something like this. <br>

![Installation](img/08.png)

<br>

I don't wanna install there. <br>
So, just like every installation, I will be installing it to _LEO_ folder. <br>

        C:\LEO\Anaconda3

Click _Next_. <br>

#### Step 2.5

It will say that it is not recommended to do it, but trust me, this is better. <br>
No matter what it says, it isn't that easy to Open Anaconda application from _Start_ menu. <br>
So, we will installing whatever we want using commands. <br>

Click _Intall_.

<br>

Click _Next_. <br>

![Installation](img/12.png)

<br>

Click _Next_. <br>

![Installation](img/13.png)

<br>

I dont wanna know about _Annaconda Individual Edition_ and neither do I wanna _Learn more about Anaconda_. So, I am unselecting them all. <br>

Click _Finish_.

### Step 3 - Verifying the Installation

To check if the installation is done properly, open command prompt and type the following. <br>

        conda -V

<br>

You must be something similar to this. <br>
